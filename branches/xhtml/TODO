Branch Goals before merging
(Ian? Can you help me here?)

Avram's Working Copy Goals before committing:
Minimal:
done 	Rewrite autoread_list(..) to spit out complete list.
done 	Write JS toggles, add to interface code.
done 	Add refresh button (auto refresh?) that recalls and repops autoread_list(..)
	Fix broken things (mark_as_read, many links)
done	Clean and repair styles
	Clean and doc new code
	
Probable:
Add to autofinger asynchronously?
Rework autoread spaghetti
Add new unread plans -- tack them on as they come?
	(incremental autofinger updates)

Maybes:
Subscribing?
More details in autofinger list -- hovers, things like that.
