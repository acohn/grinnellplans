This is a series of PHP scripts that serve to replace the .plan files that 
were used in a social context on Grinnell College's VAX before 2000, but 
which has also evolved in it's own right.

To get things started, you will need to first have a directory that is 
viewable from the web, on a server that is running PHP (see php.net for 
details) and you will also need to have a MySQL database (see mysql.com 
for details) and have privileges to change it.

Once you've downloaded these files, you will first need to change a few 
lines in dbfunctions.php. Specifically in the db_connect function, you 
will need to change mysql_servername to the name of the server that hosts 
the database, for example "dbserver.cs.grinnell.edu". Next you will need 
to change mysql_username to the name with which you have an account under 
MySQL (ex.: kenslerj). Then you will need to change mysql_password to your 
password for your account under MySQL (ex.: twi.4Mt). Finally, you will need 
to change mysql_database to the name of the MySQL database that will 
contain the data for the pages to run (ex.: plans).

The next step is that you will need to run DBsetup.php. This will set up 
the structure of the database. 

Next you will have to add a row to the styles table of your 
database, telling where at least one of your style sheets is.

Next you will have to add a row to the interfaces table of your database, 
telling where at least one of your interfaces is.

And finally, you will need to add a row to the accounts table of your 
database, creating a user, along with their password, as well as 
specifying the style number and interface number from the previous steps.
