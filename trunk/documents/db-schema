I believe this was caused by a bug in <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html\" class=\"onplan\">Apache\'s mod_rewrite module</a>.  I had started using a <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMap\" class=\"onplan\">map program</a> to correct some problems with the filesystem about two days ago.\r<br>\r<br>When the web server, Apache, starts up, it starts the map program in the background.  Each apache thread communicates with the map program using pipes.  When the server received a new request from you, it hands the request off to a child process. The child then looks at the URL you requested, realizes it needs to a translation, gives the URL to the map program, then receives the new URL back (in almost all cases, it is expected to be the same afterwards).\r<br>\r<br>What appears to have gone wrong in this case was that the child processes somehow got out of order when they picked up the remapped URLs.  As a result, the pages you were seeing were not random after all, but switched with someone else who was trying to use Plans at the same time.  For instance, if you submitted a plan edit and the same time someone else typed &quot;wellons&quot; in the read box and hit &quot;Read&quot;, the child apache processes might receive the remapped URLs in a different order than they submitted them.\r<br>\r<br>Your request for edit.php would instead be processed by read.php, which would ignore the plan content you had posted and instead look for a submitted name.  Not finding one, it would say, &quot;Must enter a name.&quot;  Similarly, the other person\'s read request would be executed by edit.php, which would ignore the &quot;wellons&quot; and instead look for Plan content.  Without it, it defaults to assuming the user wants to edit her plan and would present her with the edit pane.\r<br>\r<br>Even requests for images and stylesheets go through this process and could get switched, although I would expect it to be less common because your broswer can cache these.  Most of the time your browser would ignore substitutions like text for an image or an image for a stylesheet since they don\'t make any sense, but you might have seen others such as the tiled background image replaced by the Plans logo, or web page replaced by a stylesheet.\r<br>\r<br>No personal data was compromised because Plans doesn\'t put anything sensitive in URLs, with one exception.  If someone had registered a new plan and clicked the token link in their email and that had been switched with someone else, that someone else would have found himself looking at the &quot;Here\'s your new password ... &quot; page.  Looking at <a href=\"http://www.grinnellplans.com/lastcreated.php\" class=\"onplan\">Plans Genesis</a>, this could have happened only to [<a href=\"read.php?searchname=yurickka\" class=\"planlove\">yurickka</a>], whom I\'ll email.  However, as far as I know, the rest of Plans pages either don\'t work when submitted data is missing, or default to something innocuous.  If you can think of any other examples, please email us at grinnellplans@gmail.com.\r<br>\r<br>I\'ve switched from using a separate map program to using a text list that Apache loads into memory at runtime.  Hopefully, this will prevent this problem.\r<br>\r<br>~[<a href=\"read.php?searchname=wellons\" class=\"planlove\">wellons</a>]</p><hr><p class=\"sub\"><b>Wednesday November 28, 2007. 12:15 AM</b>\r<br>The post below is a humorous way of saying that we know Plans is being crazy right now, and we\'re working on it.

We\'ve conversed with professors, students, and alumni about both the shortcomings of secrets and the potential it holds. As an administrative team, we have spent time debating the merits and liabilities of each distinct option in order to reach an agreeable compromise. No one idea is perfect, but we have done our best to be diligent and thoughtful throughout this experiment.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>As I\'m sure many of you noticed, no secrets have been approved in the last few weeks. We chose to see how the submissions would change without the immediate gratification of anonymous discussion. The results have been encouraging. As a result, we have come to a couple of conclusions. <b>From this point forward, Secrets will be checked and approved by an admin no more than once per week.</b> In one month, we will revisit this decision to see if Secrets is something we choose to keep for the long haul.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Additionally, we propose three simple guidelines for Secrets that we hope will help return it to its original purpose. While none of these guidelines attempts to serve as an iron-clad policy prerogative, each is a goal we hope the Plans community will share and support both individually and collectively.\r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>Our guidelines are simply\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>1. No names will be used;\r<br>\r<br>2. The entry must be a secret; and\r<br>\r<br>3. The secret must be your own. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>We hope to convey that although posts on Secrets are anonymous, they are not without reprocussion. As members of the Grinnell community, Sido, Eryn and I would hope that a lack of accountability would have no bearing on the constructiveness and maturity of our peers. Unfortunately, the environment created by the several iterations of Secrets in the past month appears to have provided too much temptation. While we have maintained a view of this addition as an experiment in human behavior, we feel both empathy and sympathy for those who were disappointed, disinterested, and disconcerted by some of the more extreme Secrets posts.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Secrets was created for those who had something quiet to say and nowhere to say it. In a world of pixels and keyboard strokes, it is sometimes all too easy to disregard the humanity of those we encounter. Ultimately we seek not to censor or offend, but rather to assist in reestablishing and encouraging the standards of respect that once drew us to this community. Hopefully these guidelines will assist us in that process.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Genuinely,\r<br>\r<br>[<a href=\"read.php?searchname=goeringm\" class=\"planlove\">goeringm</a>], 2/10/06, 12:12am\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></p><hr><p class=\"sub\">[Secrets] has changed. All secrets must be approved by an admin before they are posted.

This will help keep Plans in operation by running\r<br>Plans like a business, with a top-tier management structure designed\r<br>to reflect the growing needs of you, the clientcustomeruserbase.\r<br>\r<br>Several new changes will be implemented:\r<br>\r<br>1. It has become impossible to support Plans operation through\r<br>donations. Starting next month, all users will be charged a fee for\r<br>using Plans, payable via Paypal. To keep this affordable, users will\r<br>be charged based on quantity of writing and frequency of updates. By\r<br>charging a penny per character entered per update, Plans will gain\r<br>revenue and reduce bandwidth costs.\r<br>\r<br>2. Reading Plans, however, will always remain free. Plans will defray\r<br>the bandwidth costs by using Google Adwords for advertisements. Google\r<br>Adwords works by scanning the page you are reading and recommending\r<br>relevant websites based on the content of that page. I expect that\r<br>many plans will be full of interesting advertisements as a result of\r<br>the content.\r<br>\r<br>3. The software platform Plans is running on, the [<a href=\"read.php?searchname=kenslerj\" class=\"planlove\">kenslerj</a>] hack,\r<br>will be switched to a standards-compliant platform. I am currently\r<br>considering Drupal or Livejournal. Your comments, as always, are\r<br>welcomed.

I believe this was caused by a bug in [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html|Apache\'s mod_rewrite module].  I had started using a [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMap|map program] to correct some problems with the filesystem about two days ago.\r\n\r\nWhen the web server, Apache, starts up, it starts the map program in the background.  Each apache thread communicates with the map program using pipes.  When the server received a new request from you, it hands the request off to a child process. The child then looks at the URL you requested, realizes it needs to a translation, gives the URL to the map program, then receives the new URL back (in almost all cases, it is expected to be the same afterwards).\r\n\r\nWhat appears to have gone wrong in this case was that the child processes somehow got out of order when they picked up the remapped URLs.  As a result, the pages you were seeing were not random after all, but switched with someone else who was trying to use Plans at the same time.  For instance, if you submitted a plan edit and the same time someone else typed \"wellons\" in the read box and hit \"Read\", the child apache processes might receive the remapped URLs in a different order than they submitted them.\r\n\r\nYour request for edit.php would instead be processed by read.php, which would ignore the plan content you had posted and instead look for a submitted name.  Not finding one, it would say, \"Must enter a name.\"  Similarly, the other person\'s read request would be executed by edit.php, which would ignore the \"wellons\" and instead look for Plan content.  Without it, it defaults to assuming the user wants to edit her plan and would present her with the edit pane.\r\n\r\nEven requests for images and stylesheets go through this process and could get switched, although I would expect it to be less common because your broswer can cache these.  Most of the time your browser would ignore substitutions like text for an image or an image for a stylesheet since they don\'t make any sense, but you might have seen others such as the tiled background image replaced by the Plans logo, or web page replaced by a stylesheet.\r\n\r\nNo personal data was compromised because Plans doesn\'t put anything sensitive in URLs, with one exception.  If someone had registered a new plan and clicked the token link in their email and that had been switched with someone else, that someone else would have found himself looking at the \"Here\'s your new password ... \" page.  Looking at [http://www.grinnellplans.com/lastcreated.php|Plans Genesis], this could have happened only to [yurickka], whom I\'ll email.  However, as far as I know, the rest of Plans pages either don\'t work when submitted data is missing, or default to something innocuous.  If you can think of any other examples, please email us at grinnellplans@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nI\'ve switched from using a separate map program to using a text list that Apache loads into memory at runtime.  Hopefully, this will prevent this problem.\r\n\r\n~[wellons]<hr><b>Wednesday November 28, 2007. 12:15 AM</b>\r\nThe post below is a humorous way of saying that we know Plans is being crazy right now, and we\'re working on it.

We\'ve conversed with professors, students, and alumni about both the shortcomings of secrets and the potential it holds. As an administrative team, we have spent time debating the merits and liabilities of each distinct option in order to reach an agreeable compromise. No one idea is perfect, but we have done our best to be diligent and thoughtful throughout this experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I\'m sure many of you noticed, no secrets have been approved in the last few weeks. We chose to see how the submissions would change without the immediate gratification of anonymous discussion. The results have been encouraging. As a result, we have come to a couple of conclusions. <b>From this point forward, Secrets will be checked and approved by an admin no more than once per week.</b> In one month, we will revisit this decision to see if Secrets is something we choose to keep for the long haul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we propose three simple guidelines for Secrets that we hope will help return it to its original purpose. While none of these guidelines attempts to serve as an iron-clad policy prerogative, each is a goal we hope the Plans community will share and support both individually and collectively.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur guidelines are simply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. No names will be used;\r\n\r\n2. The entry must be a secret; and\r\n\r\n3. The secret must be your own. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope to convey that although posts on Secrets are anonymous, they are not without reprocussion. As members of the Grinnell community, Sido, Eryn and I would hope that a lack of accountability would have no bearing on the constructiveness and maturity of our peers. Unfortunately, the environment created by the several iterations of Secrets in the past month appears to have provided too much temptation. While we have maintained a view of this addition as an experiment in human behavior, we feel both empathy and sympathy for those who were disappointed, disinterested, and disconcerted by some of the more extreme Secrets posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecrets was created for those who had something quiet to say and nowhere to say it. In a world of pixels and keyboard strokes, it is sometimes all too easy to disregard the humanity of those we encounter. Ultimately we seek not to censor or offend, but rather to assist in reestablishing and encouraging the standards of respect that once drew us to this community. Hopefully these guidelines will assist us in that process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenuinely,\r\n\r\n[goeringm], 2/10/06, 12:12am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>[Secrets] has changed. All secrets must be approved by an admin before they are posted. We\'ll make some sort of \"official statement\" later, including rationale for the change and the criteria we will use when deciding whether or not to display a secret, but I just wanted to let you know now why things aren\'t showing up as soon as you submit them. As usual, all questions and comments can be directed to grinnellplans@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [oneileri], 12/11/05, 5:45pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Planworld--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing tradition, Plans has been once again handed down to the younger generation. Your new plans admins are Sidone Straughn \'08 [straughn], Megan Goering \'08 [goeringm], and myself, Eryn O\'Neil \'07 [oneileri]. We hope that this passing of power should be seamless, painless, and, if we do our jobs well, do nothing but increase the overall level of happiness in your life. As always, if there are any comments or questions, you can send them to grinnellplans@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the Secrets page that was once part of [wgemigh]\'s plan now has its own page. To access it, click \"Preferences\" on the left, go to \"Optional Links\", scroll down, and put a check next to \"Secrets\". Then hit \"Submit Query\" and Secrets will show up in your list of links. There will be some changes to Secrets in the days to come, but it\'s functional right now. The old secrets can still be perused here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [oneileri], 12/4/05, 3:38pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nApril Fool\'s Day, 2006:\r\n\r\nPlans continues to have problems which have led me to take control of\r\nPlans again.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve Plans operations, several changes will be made\r\nso to improve efficiency, increase operational standards, and reduce\r\nlegal liabilities. This will help keep Plans in operation by running\r\nPlans like a business, with a top-tier management structure designed\r\nto reflect the growing needs of you, the clientcustomeruserbase.\r\n\r\nSeveral new changes will be implemented:\r\n\r\n1. It has become impossible to support Plans operation through\r\ndonations. Starting next month, all users will be charged a fee for\r\nusing Plans, payable via Paypal. To keep this affordable, users will\r\nbe charged based on quantity of writing and frequency of updates. By\r\ncharging a penny per character entered per update, Plans will gain\r\nrevenue and reduce bandwidth costs.\r\n\r\n2. Reading Plans, however, will always remain free. Plans will defray\r\nthe bandwidth costs by using Google Adwords for advertisements. Google\r\nAdwords works by scanning the page you are reading and recommending\r\nrelevant websites based on the content of that page. I expect that\r\nmany plans will be full of interesting advertisements as a result of\r\nthe content.\r\n\r\n3. The software platform Plans is running on, the [kenslerj] hack,\r\nwill be switched to a standards-compliant platform. I am currently\r\nconsidering Drupal or Livejournal. Your comments, as always, are\r\nwelcomed. This will be the easiest way to eliminate bugs and to move\r\nPlans towards a more blogosphere oriented community.\r\n\r\n4. We are changing our privacy policy. As part of our cost mitigation\r\nprocess, all usernames will be carefully monitored and usage\r\nstatistics recorded to provide to third-party businesses we share\r\nrelations with.\r\n\r\n4. In order to avoid legal liabilities, we have reached an agreement\r\nwith Grinnell College. For the safety of the campus community, we are\r\nproviding the Grinnell College ITS and Security department with review\r\naccess over every plan, in exchange for legal immunity for contents\r\nput on the system.\r\n\r\nAloha,\r\n Sechyi [Laiu] \'04\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans is currently administrated by [oneileri] \'07, [goeringm] \'08, [straughn] \'08, and [rootwile] \'09. \r\n\r\nThe server and code are currently maintained by some very very lovely alumnus code monkeys.\r\n\r\nYou can read [rootwile]\'s Sociological Study of Plans (conducted in Spring of \'06) [http://web.grinnell.edu/individuals/rootwile/plansurvey/index.html|here].\r\n');
